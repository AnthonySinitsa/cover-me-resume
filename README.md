# Cover-My-Resume

## DONE

DONE: User Registration

DONE: Resume Uploader: for the most part finished, just need add resume to database

DONE: Add a profile page that will display all the resumes user has entered

DONE: Job Scraper Integration: If your scraper is ready, integrate it so that it runs after a user uploads their resume. The scraped job postings can be stored in the JobPost model.

DONE: Display Scraped Job Postings: Create a view and template to display the scraped job postings to the user. Allow users to select which job they're interested in.

DONE: Cover Letter Generation with ChatGPT: Once a user selects a job, use the job description and the user's resume to generate a cover letter using ChatGPT. This might involve integrating with OpenAI's API or using a local ChatGPT model, depending on your setup.

DONE: Add to profile page to show all the cover letters generated

DONE: Add a page for user to enter job and location to start the scraper

DONE: When running the scraper it shouldn't take you immediately to the results page as it will display the previous results

DONE: Add loading screen/bar till the scraper finishes

DONE: fix up the job-results page to have a nav bar at top

DONE: add option to delete account

Tests: test to ensure the functionality of site. Django's built-in testing framework can be very helpful.

Styling and User Experience: Add CSS and JavaScript to enhance the look and user experience of your website. Consider using frontend frameworks/libraries like Bootstrap, or React
