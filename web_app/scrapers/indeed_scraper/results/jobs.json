    "description": "<div>\n <p><b><i>Software Engineer – Machine Vision and Automation</i></b></p> \n <p>The <b>mission</b> of the <b>Allen Institute</b> is to unlock the complexities of bioscience and advance our knowledge to improve human health. Using an open science, multi-scale, team-oriented approach, the <b>Allen Institute</b> focuses on accelerating foundational research, developing standards and models, and cultivating new ideas to make a broad, transformational impact on science.</p> \n <p>The mission of the Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics is focused on fundamental discoveries in systems neuroscience. We are interested in how the brain builds our understanding of the complex world to guide the flexible behaviors that address our biological needs. The answers will be in terms of defined neuron types and circuits interacting across the whole brain and body. We will develop next-generation methods and theories and employ a team-based approach for discovery neuroscience. Knowledge, data, models and tools will be widely shared, in part to support the development of therapies for brain disorders.</p> \n <p>We are seeking a Software Engineer to help us push the boundaries of mouse neurophysiology by automating the alignment and insertion of high-density neural probes. The initial focus will be on developing Parallax (https://github.com/allenneuraldynamics/parallax), an open-source application that uses machine vision to track the location of many Neuropixels probes in parallel. The ideal candidate will be team-oriented, results-driven, and able to communicate effectively with scientists. We hope this engineer will eventually spearhead other open-source projects that improve our ability to record neural activity across the entire brain.</p> \n <p>The Allen Institute believes that team science significantly benefits from the participation of diverse voices, experiences and backgrounds.

    "description": "Senior Software Developer Strong Preference For Individuals With Nuclear Industry Experience THIS IS A 100% REMOTE/WORK FROM HOME ROLE Visa sponsorship is not available Strong Preference For Individuals With Nuclear Industry Experience We’re looking for a highly skilled full stack developer to help build and maintain of our primary data management application, called Atom. This tool is a key part of our plan to improve the world’s ability to deliver data-heavy nuclear power construction projects on time and budget. It contains a nuclear reactor project-specific data model linking the plant safety functions, requirements, scientific analyses, documentation, tests, and more. It acts as a single source of truth across the project to help coordinate design and construction efforts. It facilitates workflows that satisfy project procedures. This role will work closely with engineering management, QA, and the internal user base to continue to build and refine the tool’s capabilities, improve the quality pedigree, monitor and improve performance as needed, and to fix bugs as they are identified. The tool is a Python/Django/DRF backend running on Linux servers with a JavaScript/Vue3/Quasar frontend SPA user interface. The developer team is relatively small: only ~5 people. We’re looking for someone who takes pride in the craft of software development, is willing to learn and understand our somewhat obscure use case, and is highly focused and self-motivated. Responsibilities: Design, implement, document, and test software based on formally defined requirements and bug reports from the in-house user base Design and implement refactorizations and maintenance to maximize near- and long-term productivity of users and developers Identify and prioritize tasks without them being explicitly assigned to you Support verification and validation efforts to prove that the codes meet specifications and are correct Systematically identify performance or productivity bottlenecks; design and implement solutions to eliminate them Perform administrative data management operations on the backend based on user and management needs Understand and translate new feature requests into formal software requirements Train and support reactor designers to use the software system Provide mentoring to other developers Support software build and testing systems (like our Jenkins instance and related dashboards) Support server configuration and maintenance needs Facilitate design reviews for ongoing developments to keep review/approval process as productive as possible Review proposed code changes and provide detailed feedback before allowing it to go live Ensure compliance with quality standards and regulatory requirements Minimum Qualifications: 5+ years of relevant experience on web application development Strong programming skills in Python and JavaScript Strong and in-depth expertise in Django Strong expertise in some JavaScript framework like Vue3 Expert capabilities with software development tools, including git, IDEs, profilers, debuggers, test frameworks, packaging tools Ability to focus and comfort with delivering a challenging project under evolving conditions, during rapid-paced development Ability and professionalism to work within the robust regulatory environment of nuclear reactor design and construction A strong commitment to software best practices, Good understanding of software quality assurance and the software development life cycle Ability to provide and receive professional feedback Preferred Qualifications: Degree in computer science, applied mathematics, or similar Expertise building and maintaining Linux application and database servers In-depth expertise with Django REST Framework Expertise in configuring and maintaining Continuous Integration systems Strong expertise in Vue3 and Quasar Experience with major industrial construction projects Experience working in NQA-1 environments Excellent written and verbal communication skills Pay rate range is expected to be $60/hour - $100/hour.
