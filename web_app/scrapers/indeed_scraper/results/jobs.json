You like making sites that are easy to use, fast, and accessible. You're someone who thrives in a small, dynamic organization where there can sometimes be large amounts of ambiguity and autonomy. You're self-directed and enjoy working independently while still having fun technical conversations with your team to determine the best route forward. If you would like to collaborate with us to implement ideas around communicating our work to the greater world we would love to talk to you.</p> \n <p> Your focus will be on the front-end, working in technologies like JavaScript, HTML and CSS. You should have a strong grasp of these technologies, and be comfortable contributing to team and organizational best practices. There will be the opportunity to work on the supporting back-end services, deployment infrastructure and other tooling–but this is a potential growth area and not something we'll assess in the interview or expect of you.</p> \n <p><b> Your Next Challenge:</b></p> \n <p> You will collaborate with our communications team, researchers, and engineers to present our institute clearly to the outside world. This includes maintaining key, long-lived public websites like allenai.org and working on interactive demos of specific research efforts. You will also work with the rest of the team to develop demos for research applications and internal tools to help us organize and present our research. For example, your next challenge might be building the interface for our open language model (OLMo), creating a portal to present our fundraising strategy as a nonprofit organization, or partnering with other engineers to build infrastructure that organizes our research datasets and publications.</p> \n <p><b> What You'll Need:</b></p> \n <p> The essential functions include, but are not limited to the following:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li>A strong interest and focus on user experience.</li> \n  <li>2+ years of industry experience building high quality web applications</li> \n  <li>Deep expertise in JavaScript, CSS and HTML.</li> \n  <li>Familiarity with TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Webpack.
