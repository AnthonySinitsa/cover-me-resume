We’re on a mission to transform the way people interact with and understand their data. We aim to empower and delight data practitioners by building an even richer, more scalable, and more collaborative experience atop the already amazing DuckDB open-source project.</p>\n <p> Our team is a diverse mix of curious, passionate, collaborative, and empathetic data industry veterans from Google, Amazon, Meta, Snowflake, SingleStore, Databricks, and the like. We’re geographically distributed across 4 engineering hubs, spanning the US and Europe.</p>\n <p></p>\n <h1 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b> Core Responsibilities</b></h1>\n <p> As an Ecosystems Engineer with MotherDuck, you will work with both MotherDuck integration partners, and internal teams to:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li><p> Build our own high quality integrations with other data products such as data notebooks, ETL/ELT pipelines, orchestration tools and many other types</p></li>\n  <li><p> Help ecosystem partners to build their own integrations with MotherDuck</p></li>\n  <li><p> Propose new features based on partner and customer patterns you've noticed</p></li>\n  <li><p> Troubleshoot a range of (easy-|hard-|exciting-|frustrating-|hilarious-)+ bugs across our stack</p></li>\n  <li><p> Use the intuition you develop while building the integrations to unblock our users across support channels, and to help other MotherDuck team members where you can (oh, you are chasing a bug with these symptoms but no clear reproduction sequence? One of our partners just ran into this; here are the exact reproduction steps!).</p></li>\n </ul>\n <p> If your first reaction when faced with a strange problem, novel/new-to-you technology or an unfamiliar customer use-case is some variation of \"huh…\", \"this is interesting…\", \"oh, I am about to learn something\", this might be your next adventure!</p>\n <p></p>\n <h1 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b> What we value</b></h1>\n <ul>\n  <li><p> Curiosity</p></li>\n  <li><p> Perseverance</p></li>\n  <li><p> Independence, tempered by knowing when asking for a second pair of eyes is more productive than going at it alone</p></li>\n  <li><p> Ability to mentally zoom out of the specific problem at hand – a simple bug can be just that, or it can be a consequence of misaligned understanding of reality, requirements or target user.</p></li>\n  <li><p> Pattern matching – have multiple users asked for something broadly similar? Can we distill this into a minimum viable requirement?</p></li>\n  <li><p> Experience with relational databases, such as PostgreSQL and DuckDB.</p></li>\n  <li><p> Working knowledge of at least two programming languages such as C++/Java/Python/Go/Typescript/Javascript in no order of preference</p></li>\n  <li><p> Excellent problem-solving and communication skills.</p></li>\n  <li><p> Ability to work effectively in a fast-paced, agile environment.</p></li>\n  <li><p> Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or a related field, or equivalent work experience.</p></li>\n  <li><p> 5+ years of experience in software development, with a focus on backend development.</p></li>\n </ul>\n <p></p>\n <h1 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b> What we provide</b></h1>\n <ul>\n  <li><p> Competitive compensation and stock options</p></li>\n  <li><p> For US-based employees:</p>\n   <ul>\n    <li><p> 100% paid medical, dental, and vision for employees</p></li>\n    <li><p> 80% paid medical, dental, and vision for dependents</p></li>\n   </ul></li>\n  <li><p> For Non-US based employees:</p>\n   <ul>\n    <li><p> You probably have a functioning health system and social safety net so healthcare is not a major factor in employment.

Please apply anyway. Research has shown that underrepresented groups in technology often shy away from roles that aren’t a 100% match. We aim to build a diverse team and will strongly consider applicants who bring many of the requirements plus have other experiences which round out their qualifications.</p>\n <p> MotherDuck is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer.
