You like making sites that are easy to use, fast, and accessible. You're someone who thrives in a small, dynamic organization where there can sometimes be large amounts of ambiguity and autonomy. You're self-directed and enjoy working independently while still having fun technical conversations with your team to determine the best route forward. If you would like to collaborate with us to implement ideas around communicating our work to the greater world we would love to talk to you.</p> \n <p> Your focus will be on the front-end, working in technologies like JavaScript, HTML and CSS. You should have a strong grasp of these technologies, and be comfortable contributing to team and organizational best practices. There will be the opportunity to work on the supporting back-end services, deployment infrastructure and other tooling–but this is a potential growth area and not something we'll assess in the interview or expect of you.</p> \n <p><b> Your Next Challenge:</b></p> \n <p> You will collaborate with our communications team, researchers, and engineers to present our institute clearly to the outside world. This includes maintaining key, long-lived public websites like allenai.org and working on interactive demos of specific research efforts. You will also work with the rest of the team to develop demos for research applications and internal tools to help us organize and present our research. For example, your next challenge might be building the interface for our open language model (OLMo), creating a portal to present our fundraising strategy as a nonprofit organization, or partnering with other engineers to build infrastructure that organizes our research datasets and publications.</p> \n <p><b> What You'll Need:</b></p> \n <p> The essential functions include, but are not limited to the following:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li>A strong interest and focus on user experience.</li> \n  <li>2+ years of industry experience building high quality web applications</li> \n  <li>Deep expertise in JavaScript, CSS and HTML.</li> \n  <li>Familiarity with TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Webpack. It's ok if you haven't used them professionally, but you should have a general understanding of how they work.</li> \n  <li>Strong understanding of the mechanics of a web browser, the differences between server-side and client execution, and the basics of the HTTP protocol.</li> \n  <li>Experience working with product and design to develop websites.</li> \n  <li>A basic understanding of UNIX development tools like git and bash, and an understanding of how programming languages like Go and Python different from JavaScript.</li> \n </ul> \n <p><b>Physical Demands and Work Environment:</b></p> \n <p> The physical demands described here are representative of those that must be met by a team member to successfully perform the essential functions of this position. Reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the functions.</p> \n <ul> \n  <li>Must be able to remain in a stationary position for long periods of time.</li> \n  <li>The ability to communicate information and ideas so others will understand. Must be able to exchange accurate information in these situations.</li> \n  <li>The ability to observe details at close range.</li> \n  <li>Can work under deadlines.</li> \n </ul> \n <p><b>A Little Bit More About AI2:</b></p> \n <p> The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence is a non-profit research institute in Seattle founded by Paul Allen.

We particularly encourage applications from women, non-binary individuals, people of color, members of the LGBTQA+ community, and people with disabilities of any kind.</li> \n  <li><b>We value inclusion - </b>We understand the value that people's individual experiences and perspectives can bring to an organization, and we are building a culture in which all voices are heard, respected and considered.</li> \n  <li><b>We emphasize a healthy work/life balance </b>– we believe our team members are happiest and most productive when their work/life balance is optimized. While we value powerful research results which drive our mission forward, we also value dinner with family, weekend time, and vacation time. We offer generous paid vacation and sick leave as well as family leave.</li> \n  <li><b>We are collaborative and transparent </b>– we consider ourselves a team, all moving with a common purpose. We are quick to cheer our successes, and even quicker to share and jointly problem solve our failures.</li> \n  <li><b>We are in Seattle </b>– and our office is on the water!
